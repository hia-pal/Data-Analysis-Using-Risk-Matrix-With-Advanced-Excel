## Risk Analysis of mechanical suppulier for prototypes. 

### Risk description: 

1. Engineering Technicians will not be available during October.
2. Components are not available for building the prototype.
3. Supplier proposals are significantly overbudget.
4. 4Mechanical design mechanism does not engage mating components.
5. Rinsing step does not remove toxic materials.
6. Equipment size is larger than available foorprint
7. SQ is not backwards compatible with older revesions
8. There is interference between the panel and the PCB cable components
9. Equipment testing does not meet requirements
10. Team is not able to travel to supplier due to budgetary restrictions

### Impact Description: 

1. Product build will be delayed by 1 month
2. Customer validation of the prototypes will be delayed by several weeks.
3. The project will be at a standstill. The team will need additional funding to proceed with the project.
4. Prototype will not meet functional requirements
5. This will be a safety hazard to the operators.
6. Equipment cannot be used on mfg floor
7. Equipment in the field will not be able to use the most latest SW revesion
8. The panel design will not assemble correctly and all units manufactured will need to be reworked
9. The design will need to be modified and all testing activities will need to be repeated
10. The engineering team will not be able to evaluate the equipment's functionality before it is delivered onsite
